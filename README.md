# hello-world

I'm going through the intro activities for GitHub, and creating my first repository here. 

I know nothing about code, but I work closely with our Dev Team, so I'd like to learn more about their tracking system here in GitHub. Maybe someday I will learn to code, as that seems to be the future of the world!
